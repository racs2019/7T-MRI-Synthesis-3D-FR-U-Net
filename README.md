# 7T MRI Synthesis from 3T Using Deep Learning

This repository supports the research presented in the paper:

**"Semi-Supervised Synthesis of 7T MRI from 3T Using 3D FR-U-Net with Clinically-Relevant Anatomical Assessment"**  
*Richard Acs, Hanqi Zhuang* ‚Äî Florida Atlantic University

This project investigates volumetric 7T MRI synthesis from 3T T1-weighted MRI using three deep learning models:

- **3D-FR-U-Net**: A 3D Multi-Scale Fusion Residual U-Net trained on paired 3T/7T data.
- **Semi-Supervised 3D-FR-U-Net**: An extension that incorporates unpaired 7T data through hybrid supervised-consistency loss.
- **Pix2Pix**: A 2D GAN-based model adapted for MRI synthesis with ResNet-based attention.

## Data Statement

This research uses publicly available MRI datasets:

1. **Paired 3T/7T MRI Dataset**  
   - From Chen et al. (2023), includes 10 subjects with co-registered 3T and 7T scans.  
   - Source: [Scientific Data, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02400-y)

2. **Unpaired 7T Dataset**  
   - From Li et al. (2024), includes 20 healthy subjects with high-quality T1-weighted 7T MRI.  
   - Source: [MICCAI 2024 Proceedings]

All scans were normalized to [0, 1], and split into overlapping patches of size 64√ó64√ó64 with a stride of 32 for training and inference.
